# Information from the repository
Lab 2 of the course Advanced visualization, done in the fourth year.
We have three objects to which we apply two different lighting models: PBR and IBL.

The framework has been developed in C++and the lighting models have been implemented in OpenGL.

In addition to the files, we find a demonstration video and an executable in which we can see the result. 

I have also included a report in which we explain in detail the implementation.

### Instructions
To see the final result, run the *framework.exe* file.

To see the project in Visual Studio, run the file *visualstudio2015.sln* that we find inside the folder *visualstudio15*.

The project has been done on the basis of a framework developed in C++ by [Javi Agenjo](https://github.com/jagenjo).
